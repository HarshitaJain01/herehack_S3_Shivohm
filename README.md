number of decisions need to be taken quickly when an

with family and friends, at a single location Easily 
available with just one click.

Our application contains a number of SOS features, including a 
medical emergency function that proposes nearby hospitals and 
aids in connecting to them. We also have a variety of helplines 
that may be connected, including police stations, a women's 
hotline, and fire fighters. For last-minute emergencies, we also 
make it simple for users to find local hotels to stay in.
